Why React?
React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces by Facebook and Instagram. Many people choose to think of React as the V in MVC.
React is used to solve one problem: building large applications with data that changes over time.

Declarative
React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.
Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.

Component-Based
Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.


//React and Angular
Kumar Sanket为Toptal公司的全栈Web开发者/工程师，他在一篇文章《Why I Ditched Angular for React》中对Angular和React进行了对比，他表示Angular在快速开发大型Web项目上很受推崇，但其也存在的种种缺陷，如过于依赖DOM操作，双向数据绑定带来性能问题等。而React作为由Facebook和Instagramin领导的新开源项目，为JavaScript应用开发者提供了新的开发方式，同时具有速度快、跨浏览器兼容、模块化等优点，也是这些优点，让Kumar Sanket选择了React。
